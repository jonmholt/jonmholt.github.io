As many of you know, I currently sit on the Servus Board of Directors.

As someone who reads this blog, I know you signed up for pieces on designing your business, solar technologies or Ironman triathlon (you are a varied bunch, aren't you?). But I hope you will indulge me in something else that is near and dear to my heart: credit unions.

Servus is a Credit Union.  A credit union is like a bank where everyone who does business there is an owner.  We all own the place! And as an owner, we all have a super power: we get to elect the board of directors.

The thing is, I'm tired of seeing so few of our members vote. In 2016 there were only 2850 people out of over 390,000 that voted in the Board election.

**I'm hoping that between you and I, we can convince a few more to step up to the plate.**

Over the next few weeks, you're going to get a few emails from me answering a bunch of the most common questions I get asked about the board and the election, such as:

 * So what does a board do, anyway?
 * Isn't the board just an old boys club?
 * How do I know these people are qualified?
 * But what is one vote gonna do?

If you have any questions about the board, the process, or just anything at all really, please just send me an email. I'll do my best to answer.

If you know of anyone who banks at Servus, send them here to my blog at [http://twentyfivetwenty.ca/](http://twentyfivetwenty.ca/tag/ServusSuperHeroes), where I'll eventually post these questions too. The more we can get on board the better.

Otherwise, I'm looking forward to helping you on your journey to credit union democracy.
