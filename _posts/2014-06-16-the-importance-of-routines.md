You don't really realize the importance of routines until you break them. &nbsp;I know, all you hear all the time is don't get in a rut, constantly reinvent, find a new you. &nbsp;But in all that finding, you can lose track of who you are and what's important. &nbsp;Take this writing for example. &nbsp;I've been pretty religious now for over a month to practice daily (well, week-daily) writing. &nbsp;As much just to put in the time as to express something specific. &nbsp;I've been able to do that because I've made a place in my day to do that. &nbsp;Travelling has nearly de-railed the whole enterprise.

<a name="more"></a>I find writing a place to synthesize much of what has occurred during the day. &nbsp;To distill down the entire day into one or two salient things to remember. &nbsp;Kind of like the "30 second task that will make you a superhero" or whatever that blog was called: take time during the day to write down what was important so you don't have to try to figure it out later. &nbsp;When I travel, it's usually for work. &nbsp;Often in the credit union. &nbsp;So I travel long distances to spend long days doing hard mental gymnastics, often with evening commitments. &nbsp;Finding the time to sit and write even a measly 500 words is daunting. &nbsp;Add a 2am flight arrival and it's almost impossible.

To some extent this is a test of perseverance. &nbsp;But I think more accurately that I now finally understand why something so simple as taking 30 seconds at the end of every meeting to write down what the important points were can be so effective: it's hard. &nbsp;It's hard to force yourself to stop and take time to think. &nbsp;It's hard to decide what is salient. &nbsp;It's hard not to just move on to the next thing.

So today, I learned about a startling real-food cafeteria program in francophone schools, a local famers cooperative, a farm-as-therapy for mental illness and a 100km winery. &nbsp;And what is the salient point that I've brought home? &nbsp;Co-op people are good people. &nbsp;It is hard to explain the difference values can make until you see cooperatives in action. &nbsp;So here's to values. &nbsp;Here's to perseverance. &nbsp;Here's to hard work. &nbsp;And here's to routines.
