There is a certain pride in dirty hands. &nbsp;Dirty hands to me mean that I've done something tangible, something of substance, something that required 3 dimensional, creative thinking. &nbsp;As someone with a relatively cognitive profession, I don't get to see tangible products all that often. But as someone with the need to create, dare I say, a maker, dirty hands are often a sign that I'm in my happy place.

<a name="more"></a>Many a mechanic or a roughneck would be the first to tell you that dirty hands are just part of the job. I once had this described to me with a question: "Do you shower before work, or after?" For people that build and make and produce on a daily basis, there certainly isn't the novelty in dirty hands that those of us that shower before work might experience. &nbsp;But I don't think that it is the novelty of dirty hands that is the crux but rather the novelty of the product. &nbsp;I think that the joy comes from knowing that something exists in this world now that didn't when my hands were clean. &nbsp;If you replace transmissions on the same car every day all day, the world doesn't have anything new for your labour. &nbsp;But if you bend your brain around replacing that truck transmission with one from a Viper, well I'd bet even the most jaded of mechanics would be proud of the dirt on his hands that day.

Day to day I'm building better companies or better software; I'm taking what is there and helping it make a leap towards its future self. &nbsp;Sometimes I get to see what my efforts reap years down the road, but most often I don't. &nbsp;Even when through my labour new software emerges into the world, I don't get the same rush I do from installing a new turbo, building a fence or even crosshatching my lawn as I mow. &nbsp;As the world becomes more virtual, making an impact get more difficult. &nbsp;At its simplest, I get the most joy from those things I make that make a dent in gravity.

So if I show up at a meeting and you notice PL 400 on my hands or paint in my hair, consider yourself lucky. &nbsp;I've just come from making something and you're likely to receive the benefit of my heightened stillness, my afterglow of creation, my happiness. &nbsp;Even for those of you who shower after work, work every day to find that moment, however small, where you are proud of the dirt because of what you've made.
