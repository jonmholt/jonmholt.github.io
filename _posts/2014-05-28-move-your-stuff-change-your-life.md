Once every three or four years, we look at our house and move stuff around in the name of the future. &nbsp;We adjust the colour palette. &nbsp;We tidy, organize and purge. &nbsp;We add decorative items that enhance the energy and we affirm our intentions for the space in our home and in our life. No, we're not HGTV aficionados with a penchant for interior design. &nbsp;We're devout "well, it can't hurt" practitioners of &nbsp;Feng Shui.

<a name="more"></a>While science will never prove it, I'm a pretty big believer in the fact that there are external factors affecting every facet of our lives every day. &nbsp;Call it what you will, but it seems that there are energies, extraterrestrials or deities desperately trying to sway us in advantageous directions. &nbsp;All you have to do is listen. &nbsp;But we all put up road blocks. &nbsp;Whether they're mental or physical, we do our darnedest to make it difficult for any one or anything to sway us away from our current normal.

Feng Shui is the ancient chinese art ... and I use art intentionally ... of increasing the universe's capacity to positively impact your life. &nbsp;The idea is that each of the facets of our life has certain synchronistic elements, colours and positions that will allow and enhance energy flow. &nbsp;From one perspective, it's nuts. &nbsp;I admit that. &nbsp;From another, though, one could argue that Feng Shui is a set of guidelines that satisfy our overwhelmingly consistent human inclinations towards certain visual cues that calm and focus our minds. &nbsp;A calm mind is a successful mind. &nbsp;Much like taking the time to reach a [meditative state](http://www.twentyfivetwenty.ca/2014/05/zen-and-art-of-road-cycling.html), you are a much nicer and more successful person when you can focus.

So from the flowing glass sculpture in my career area to the candle and statue of Buddha in my knowledge and skills area, I welcome the winds of change into my life. &nbsp;I create a hospitable and welcoming entrance to my home and my mind and hope that some good will come. &nbsp;If nothing else, the house is clean, tidy and organized and who can complain about that.
