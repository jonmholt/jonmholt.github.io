I left the employed world almost 2 years ago to work as a hired gun.  That quickly turned into the entreprenurial venture you see before you today.  Like most consulting gigs, it wasn't too long into it that the work dried up for an extended period.  Now for some, that is the ultimate fear of "going out on your own."  What do you do when the contracts disappear?  I spent a long time just talking to folks I know in the industry, and fairly universally the reaction was sympathetic.  The sympathy was misplaced, though, I think because I discovered that I must be doing the right thing.  I constantly referred to my sitation as "the best job I ever had, if only it came with a paycheck."  So how did I know I was doing the right thing, well, here's a few things I learned along the journey that made it truly worth-while:
you still think its the best job you've ever had even when it doesn't come with a pay-cheque.  This my friends is entrepreneurialism.
