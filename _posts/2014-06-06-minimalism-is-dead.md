For the better part of the last 2 years, I have run in what most would call a minimalist shoe. &nbsp;I don't have the goofy toe-shoes that have cause all the [controversy](http://www.runnersworld.com/general-interest/vibram-agrees-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit) the last little while, but I was a big fan of my Merrell minimalist runners. &nbsp;As a training shoe they have been absolutely marvellous and I've done two half ironmen in them and at least one hand's worth of half-marathons. &nbsp;The thing is, anything over 23km at a time or over 35km in a week and I destroy my body. &nbsp;Today was the first day I went back to cushioned shoes.

<a name="more"></a>There have been grumblings for years about the decline of this fad towards less and less shoe for runners. &nbsp;Its [future](http://runblogger.com/2012/12/the-future-of-minimalist-running-shoes.html) was questioned even as I got into it in 2012 and as predicted sales began to [dive](http://www.runnersworld.com/minimalist-shoes/sales-of-minimalist-shoes-plummet) early in 2013\. &nbsp;For me, it was a chance to learn how to run again. &nbsp;Take away all the crutches built into modern day shoes, think consciously about your running form and build strength where it was missing before. &nbsp;The minimalist movement allowed me to find both speed and a comfort in medium distance running.

But as I built up my distance for Ironman this year, I began to experience an inflammation of a tendon tunnel in my right calf/achilles. &nbsp;This is akin to a burning hot poker stuck into the back of your leg that someone kicks every time you flex your foot. &nbsp;It was sore, but manageable for months, but as the weekly milage crept over 50km, it became debilitating. &nbsp;Once bout of ART and a switch back to my neutral cushioned shoes, however and it's all gone. &nbsp;32km today and no pain at all. 

While I see the movement as dead and my participation done too (I'm stubborn you know), I still think there was value in minimalist running shoes. &nbsp;I like to think that two of Brian Metzler&nbsp;[&nbsp;thoughts](http://running.competitor.com/2013/08/shoes-and-gear/sole-man-10-things-about-the-minimalist-trend_81962) on minimalist running were key: minimalism was necessary to curb the gluttony of the development of running shoes and minimalism helped runners think about their running mechanics. &nbsp;While I'll keep the Merrells around for short runs in the future, for long distance I like my cushioning.
