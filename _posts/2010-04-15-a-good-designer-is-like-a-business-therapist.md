We recently worked on a rebranding (hope you like it).  We have a fantastic designer who has produced a phenomenal brand book.  I look at the investment we put into the re-branding and in my darker moments think about the ROI: is that little logo worth good hard dollars?  But I realized that the value in the money spent is less about the fonts, colours and logos that come with the brand, it was in the journey we took to get there.  Much like a good therapist, our designer took us on a journey of self-discovery that forced us to distill who and what we are.  Its that sense of purpose that we bought with our hard earned dollars, and we got a logo for free.  Because a lot of good came out of the process, I thought it would be valuable to me, as much as anyone, to document the questions asked and the journey to the response.<a name="more"></a>What does the E stand for?

We've settled on _Experience_.  E can be for electronic, enterprise, everybody, exciting, and many other words besides, but we determined that at our core, we are about creating an experience for our clients.  Its in the introduction, its in the delivery, its in the billing, its in the compassion.  We fail if our involvement with a client isn't an experience that they linger on and expect of others.

What colours are important to you?

Calm, cool, strong colours.  Blues and greens.  Grey's over blacks.  But not too blue.  We're committed to sustainability, empathy, responsibility and foremost a good experience.

Who do you see yourself as?

We're the google of health information.  We're the Westjet of consulting organizations (without the frequent flyer miles).  We're the people that care...truly care about you and your problems.

What is the essence of your message?

How can we help?
