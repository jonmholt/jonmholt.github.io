When I walk out of the airport arrivals lounge I typically head to pick up my suitcase and then find my place in the long line for a cab ride home. &nbsp;There is nothing better than that lurch at the back of your stomach when you walk out the security door and your subconscious recognizes a face. &nbsp;The face of your son, your daughter, your wife. &nbsp;Your subconscious knows immediately what is going on, but it takes your conscious mind a few seconds to catch up. &nbsp;At first there's the "did I just see a familiar face" reaction, which is quickly followed by "gee that looks like my son", to "wait, Alex is here?" and finally, "they came to get me! &lt;&lt;sniffle&gt;&gt;". &nbsp;The joy of seeing your family when you've been away for any length is like no other.

<a name="more"></a>But sometimes we forget that. &nbsp;When life is hectic and you're rushing from task to task, we tend to put our attention on checking off the next item. &nbsp;Sometimes what is necessary in life is just stopping to love your family but when you're on a mission to _accomplish_, stopping for any reason feels only like an obstacle in the way of your goal. &nbsp;While I'm not sure I go so far as to say _[To-do lists will kill you](https://www.facebook.com/james.altucher/posts/10152113974395636)_, like James Altucher, I do believe you need to focus on the truly important things first, and the to-do lists next. &nbsp;How many of us put "Listen to kid talk about Pokemon cards" on their to-do list? &nbsp;Or, "Give daughter hug"? &nbsp;This seems disingenuous; we think "I don't need to put that on my list", and we'd be right. &nbsp;The problem is that we often forget to do those things when we're in the middle of getting things done.

I hate travelling, because it means I'm not here for the family. &nbsp;I hate the stress it puts on my wife, the kids, the dog, and frankly, me. &nbsp;But I also love it because every time I go away I realize how important those little things that sometimes seem like chores are really the most important things in the world. &nbsp;I realize how important my family is to me, and what my priorities need to be in life. &nbsp;I'm priviliedged enough to get to spend an inordinate amount of time with my family...far more than most working parents. &nbsp;And I guard that jealously. &nbsp;Sometime to the detriment of my income. &nbsp;But for me, the opportunity to take my daughter her raincoat because she forgot it can be far more important. &nbsp;To me, for whom love is&nbsp;_[acts of service](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/2009/02/acts-of-service/),_&nbsp;that is love.

I'm thrilled that I'm home now for a few months. &nbsp;I'm excited for summer holidays which will give me the chance to spend those months with my entire family. &nbsp;And while I know that the lists will creep in and that impatience will rear its ugly head, I hope for all our sakes I will remember that lurch of homecoming and how important my family is to me.
