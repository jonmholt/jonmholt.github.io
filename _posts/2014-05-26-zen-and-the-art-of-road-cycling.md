Just breathe. &nbsp;Full, fluid, strokes. &nbsp;IF at .68 and falling: good. &nbsp;Speed at 29.6 and climbing: good. Slight downhill, wind behind me: go go go. &nbsp;47km in: still conserving. 5 minutes until fuel. &nbsp;I had GU last time so just liquid fuel this time. &nbsp;We'll hit that at the top of the next hill. &nbsp;Traps and shoulders down, stretch the neck. &nbsp;Watch for obstacles. &nbsp;The shoulder narrows up ahead...how far is that car behind me? At this speed that next left should be in about 15 minutes. &nbsp;Watch for range road 215\. &nbsp;IF at .67 and holding: good. &nbsp;Speed at 29.7 and holding. 

<a name="more"></a>I've been asked many times what I think about when I'm on my bike for the long rides. &nbsp;And it's a valid question. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the answer isn't a very exciting one. &nbsp;In order to ride that long, there is a constant stream of measurement and reaction. &nbsp;A constant fiddling with the power output, the gear ratios, the nutrition regime and reacting to weather. &nbsp;Other than thinking this moment's contribution to my overall race total, all I think about is what I'm doing right this second. &nbsp;There is nothing quite so zen as the singular focus on the current instant that long-distance road cycling allows.

The meditative effect that a 150+ km bike can provide is nothing short of miraculous. &nbsp;If you're someone like me who's brain is regularly going in about 12 different directions, at least one long, meditative stretch every week is essential to staying sane. &nbsp;I'm a much nicer, more relaxed person when training for ironman (well, at least this time I am). &nbsp;And I attribute all of that to the long rides.

Once ironman is done, though, I don't tend to want to hop on the bike for a while. &nbsp;Like, a couple of weeks, a while. &nbsp;I know from past experience that this doesn't do good things for my mental state. &nbsp;Having come to realize how important that meditative phase is in my week, I think I'm going to have to find a way to keep it a part of my weekly regime, without or without my bike. Wish me luck. &nbsp;Namaste.
