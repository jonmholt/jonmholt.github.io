In the music industry, there is a term called phrasing that, at it simplest, encapsulates how a particular artist takes a song and makes it their own. &nbsp;The true genius of gifted artists is to know music and a particular piece so well that it allows them to sing the same song but make it different. &nbsp;I think we all intuitively know when a particular song is different. &nbsp;Sometimes it's better, sometimes not. &nbsp;But have you ever tried to explain _what_ is different?

As an example for your consideration, lets listen to the White Stripes [Seven Nation Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY). &nbsp;This is a seminal song in my life for various reasons, but take a minute and try to describe what makes the White Stripes version distinct. &nbsp;I came up with words like grungy, visceral, pulsating. &nbsp;I hear, in many ways, the emotions that come from hearing that song. &nbsp;Next compare the [Ben L'Oncle version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDNG4ewIkXk). &nbsp;Do you hear the same song? &nbsp;Do you feel the same emotions? &nbsp;I found words like "it's more funk, more soul". &nbsp;It's more crisp, bright...certainly less dark, despite the same lyrics. &nbsp;I intuitively know this. &nbsp;I hear it. &nbsp;I feel it.

Now try to explain to an 8 year old what makes one version funk and one version grungy rock. &nbsp;Its like explaining the difference between fear and trepidation. &nbsp;Between love and lust. &nbsp;Between sad and disappointed. &nbsp;It is _not_ easy. &nbsp;So how is something like that intuition learned? &nbsp;If I played both versions for the 8 year old, would putting the words I'd chosen next to them be enough? &nbsp;Do I need a lot of examples of each. &nbsp;Would he agree? &nbsp;Does he have other words? Would you? 

So today I thank all the musical influences in my life for exposing me to the emotions of such a broad range of music. &nbsp;I thank all the word smiths and all people in my life who taught me the words to encompass those emotions. &nbsp;But most of all, I thank the 8 year old for giving me pause to think about what I know intuitively and wonder why.
