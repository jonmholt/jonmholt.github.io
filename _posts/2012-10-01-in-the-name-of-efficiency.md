When you think about efficiency I'm guessing you think about savings: cost savings, time savings, overall improvements in delivery. &nbsp;More and more, efficiency has come to mean environmental efficiency: less CO2, less water, less travel, less mining, more recycling. &nbsp;Sometimes efficiency means getting a job done with the least amount of questions, interruptions or changes. &nbsp;But if anything is clear to me, its that efficiency is not the same to all people in every situation.

<a name="more"></a>This concept is the key to viewpoints in enterprise architecture. &nbsp;The data is the data, it remains what it is capturing state and relationships and process. &nbsp;Where the true magic of enterprise architecture enters is the ability to&nbsp;distil&nbsp;that information in the key pieces of information that a particular audience is looking to see. &nbsp;Do the analytics and the aggregation ahead of time, and present that particular audience with it own viewpoint into the data that makes the most sense to them. &nbsp;The same data, for a different audience, with a different perspective results in a different viewpoint of the data.

Efficiency, then, is just a viewpoint. &nbsp;From the perspective of an invester, efficiency is producing the same thing for less cost so that profits go up. &nbsp;From the perspective of an&nbsp;environmentalist, efficiency is production the same thing for more cost so that environmental impact goes down. &nbsp;From an health and safety perspective, efficiency is production of the same thing more safely so that lost-work time goes down. &nbsp;Its all about the perspective.

So, just for a fun example of perspective, I bring exhibit A, the delivery of my new laptop. &nbsp;To me, efficiency would be getting the package to me from its source in the shortest time/distance possible. &nbsp;Now as I'm sure you've picked up, I'm quite fond of [user experience](http://www.twentyfivetwenty.ca/search/label/user%20experience) and&nbsp;believe&nbsp;that [form ](http://www.twentyfivetwenty.ca/2010/09/function-without-form-is-no-function-at.html)is important, so the actual delivery path _looks_ something like this:

As you can see, UPS's definition of efficiency cannot be the same as mine. &nbsp;For them, I surmise, efficiency is about processing plants, airports large enough for their planes,&nbsp;collocation&nbsp;of staff and centralization of border control. &nbsp;For me it looks like lunacy, but I'll let you be the judge because if I one thing is true, its that your perspective will be different than mine.
