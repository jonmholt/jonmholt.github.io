I once read a quote somewhere that said "Parenting is the art of slowly shifting the family dynamic from an autocracy to a democracy". &nbsp;When I first heard that quote, I thought to myself that the hard part is knowing how fast to go how far down that spectrum. &nbsp;It turns out, and I'm barely started down that spectrum, that the hard part is democracy. &nbsp;When you've got things to get done, democracy doesn't work very well.

<a name="more"></a>I'm sure in the Roman pantheon, those enlightened souls sat about in calm dialog about the best possible choices for the greater good. &nbsp;But my children are not Greek sages. &nbsp;Nor for that matter am I. &nbsp;At first I assumed that the real problem was that the children would only vote for their own self interest. &nbsp;This meant, as I saw it, that I was invariably being inconvenienced. &nbsp;The real issue was that my single vote did not protect my own interests, and as such, democracy must be broken.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. &nbsp;Lets try this in a different context. &nbsp;Modern politicians are not greek sages. &nbsp;I mean, look at the truly vast numbers of people that they represent and the huge numbers of members of the legislative assembly or parliament. &nbsp;It is not possible to make everyone happy all of the time, so they do their best to make the best possible choices about the greater good. &nbsp;And if we the constituents aren't happy with the way our elected officials cast their votes, well, that's only because they did not support our own self-interests. &nbsp;At least we know that the majority of people cast votes asking these folks to make decisions on our behalf...oh, they didn't? What's a first past the post? &nbsp;Well never mind.

As it turns out, autocracy doesn't work for anyone past the age of 1 (except for the autocrat). Democracy in the greater world and in the family is hard. &nbsp;Really hard. &nbsp;Like anything worth doing, whether that be running a country or being part of a family, one has to work at it every day. &nbsp;One has to listen hard, understand the issues, discuss solutions, and vote for the one you believe is in the best interests of all. &nbsp;The hard part is accepting the will of the group and supporting it even if you are inconvenienced. &nbsp;Democracy is hard, but worth it.
