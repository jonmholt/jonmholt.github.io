I know.  I shouldn't have.  There's usually substance abuse involved. But I did.

Just yesterday I was lamenting how hard it can be to settle in to relax when all your routines have been taken away.  I was whining about how I can't just sit and have a beer.  I can't just grab a pizza and watch a movie.  It's hard not just because I can't have it any more, but fundamentally because I don't want it anymore.  But I still haven't found a replacement for those rituals that let me relax in the same way.  I bought myself some gluten free beer tonight just to make pretending a little bit easier.

On the way home I passed a guy pushing all his worldly possessions in a cart. He looked ragged and broken.  But he walked with purpose.  And he walked with a bounce in his step.  And he asked if I might give him a beer.  At first I said no.  Then he offered to buy it with the change he'd collected today.  I thought to myself...isn't that enterprising.  Then I realized that relaxing must be much much harder for him than my first world problems make it for me.  I decided that he deserved the right to relax just as much as the next guy.

So I gave a homeless man a beer.
