I was really fascinated to see an article published in wired this month on the fact that science has made a new discovery: [dad's brains change with children too](http://www.wired.com/2014/07/how-becoming-a-father-changes-your-brain/). &nbsp;We've long known that [Mom's brain's are different](http://news.ubc.ca/2014/05/02/moms-brain-is-different/), but this is the first time I've heard a study looking specifically for changes in a male brain, since we don't have the pregnancy thing as marker.

<a name="more"></a>The changes that they discuss are largely focused on the development or reduction of gray matter in specific areas of the brain. &nbsp;What each of those changes means, however, is mostly a guess. &nbsp;They discuss, for instance, changes to the pre-frontal cortex which is involved in memory and decision making. &nbsp;They discuss, the anterior cingulate cortex which is all about emotion. &nbsp;They even discuss changes in the parts of our brain that are thought to activate when we retreat into ourselves, and the reduction therein as a result of baby. None of these things, though, are really a surprise to me.

Having kids should change you. &nbsp;You should have a visceral need to alter you normal behaviours and decisions in order to ensure the best life for your kids. &nbsp;You should have a deep, previously un-felt, emotional experience since there is no love like the love for your child. &nbsp;You should have to pull yourself out of that self-centeredness that we've all experienced and give your everything to your child, because as a new born they can't understand that daddy just needs a minute. &nbsp;In short, if having a baby doesn't change your (and your brain), not only are you doing something wrong, you're seriously missing out.

There are no cooler people in my life than my kids. &nbsp;My wife is pretty special, and I couldn't get through life without her, but kids are different. &nbsp;They can push my buttons better than anyone else on earth. &nbsp;And they bring me joy like nobody else on earth. &nbsp;And frankly, they make me a better person. &nbsp;So thanks kids, for my daddy brain. &nbsp;It is a deep and unabiding improvement on the previous model.
