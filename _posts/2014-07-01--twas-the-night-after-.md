Just for those really into the details, I thought I would post a quick summary of my self-made 70.3\.  As a summary it was a bit slow overall but a solid effort in the swim and the bike.  The run felt extremely hot and I ignored my pace and set off way too fast...the result was obvious.

While I planned to start right at 7am, we got started a little late in the morning. The day was certainly ideal in terms of weather conditions: clear blue skies and only a little wind. &nbsp;I set off straight out into Buffalo lake and maintained a fairly straight course headed out. &nbsp;On the way back, I struggled with what seemed like an odd current pushing me further west than I was aiming, but who knows it might just have been tired arms.

Because road conditions from the lake weren't ideal, I had the longest T1 in history, 12:24, but that involved a 2km drive to the pavement so I could start the ride. &nbsp;In terms of race organizer, I forgot to put the water in the car so had to send my trusty race support vehicle back to camp for the water...we met up a couple of kms later before I headed out onto the 601\. &nbsp;The beautiful pavement and slight wind at my back for the first 20kms made for a brilliant start. &nbsp;Then I hit the crap pavement of the 56 and the 12\. Sigh, those were some of the worst roads in my cycling history. &nbsp;Once I hit Alix and turned back onto the 601 things went beautifully. &nbsp;So beautifully, in fact, that even after doing a couple of loops to bring my distance up to 90km at the end of the pavement, race support was still catching up on breakfast, so I ended up riding an additional 2kms to my running shoes.

The plan for the run changed a bit the night before, which was a good thing. &nbsp;Rather than running a somewhat untested loop, we decided to run an out and back to The Summer Village of Whitesands. This proved a good plan with starting the run at a different spot that originally envisioned. &nbsp;The run itself was largely on gravel, in the blazing 21 degree sun, with dust from vehicles coating me inside and out. &nbsp;Not ideal. &nbsp;To add insult to injury I let my ego get the best of me and took off at a 5:09 pace. &nbsp;Needless to say, I didn't keep that up. &nbsp;I finished up the run with an average pace of 5:56 min/km but I was moving pretty slowly by the end.

All told, redonculously long transitions included, I finished the day with a total time of 6:31\. &nbsp;That doesn't bode well for an ironman sub-12, but it certainly means I'll finish faster than my first attempt. &nbsp;fingers crossed.
