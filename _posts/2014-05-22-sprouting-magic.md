Dulse. Medjool dates. &nbsp;Maca. &nbsp;Hemp. &nbsp;If these are words that make you hungry, congratulations, you are a successful hippie. &nbsp;Now don't get me wrong, I'm right in there with you...well, maybe not on the hungry part, but....these are all ingredients in a natural, home-made, recovery drink that I'm trying. &nbsp;As a gluten and dairy free person, many of the off the shelf recovery drinks are hard to take. &nbsp;I find, as I explore my nutrition as part of my [training](http://www.twentyfivetwenty.ca/2013/11/ironman-2014-training-plans-off-season.html), that I lean more and more to the vegan athletes (i.e. the ones that don't drink milk or use whey protein). &nbsp;This [particular recipe](http://www.nomeatathlete.com/post-workout-recovery/) comes from Matt Frazier, the No Meat Athlete...well technically from Brendan Brazier's [Thrive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738212547?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nomeaath-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0738212547), but reprinted with commentary from Matt.

<a name="more"></a>So when I say I'm trying this recipe, I haven't actually consumed any. &nbsp;The reason being, you can't buy sprouted buckwheat. &nbsp;Who knew? &nbsp;So before I can gratefully consume a post workout recovery drink, I have to sprout me some buckwheat. &nbsp;Now before you go questioning my choice of recipe, buckwheat is not in fact wheat. &nbsp;Fun fact. &nbsp;It is a seed. &nbsp;And a very good one at that. &nbsp;I'm relatively familiar with sprouting grain from my pre-GF brewing days. &nbsp;Sprouting barley is a key part of making malt. &nbsp;I am quite intrigued with this process, though, because I've long thought that a decent GF brew could be made with a combination of other malts and this a kickstart in that direction. &nbsp;But I digress.

So what is sprouting? &nbsp;For those of you not on the hippie journey, sprouting is a process where you encourage the seed to start what nature made it for: to start growing into a plant. &nbsp;The only difference is we humans are mean, we don't let it actually grow into a plant, we eat it only a couple of days into this process. &nbsp;If you're wondering why one might go to the trouble, the answer is the same for both beer and smoothies: sprouting is the natural process where the seed takes all of its inaccessible nutrition and makes it available to those who would consume it. &nbsp;Much like the yeast in beer, I'm trying to get at the sugars and nutrients locked away in the raw groat. &nbsp;Fun fact, groat is the word for hulled seed. &nbsp;Again, who knew.

When all this sprouting and blending comes to fruition, I will of course update you on the result. &nbsp;This will likely be the most expensive recovery drink known to man given what some of these ingredients cost, but if it works, I'm willing to give it a go. &nbsp;No one who's ever gone down the Ironman road would ever claim that it was cheap. &nbsp;Keep sprouting!
