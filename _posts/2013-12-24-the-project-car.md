In case you haven't been around lately to hear my blather, a few months ago I bought myself a project car. &nbsp;Yup, I'm venturing into the world of DIY automotive repair. &nbsp;Why you ask? &nbsp;Well, damn fine question really. &nbsp;I guess just because, fundamentally, I like to understand how everything works, and you can't truly understand without getting your hands dirty. &nbsp;My plan is to blog a few fairly detailed posts every time I open the hood, but I thought to kick it off, I'd start with the plan.

<a name="more"></a>So what is the project car? &nbsp;It's a 2008 Mini Cooper S (R56). &nbsp;I picked this car for a few reasons:

1.  It was relatively cheaply available
2.  It has the structure and the stability to hold up to the mods
3.  It has a relatively easily accessible engine cavity to make it easy for this nubeWhen I first got it, the timing chain went...a common problem with this model, and so I've had that replaced along with a new high output fuel pump.  So on to the plan.  Stage 1 for me is the intake system.  I plan on replacing most of the input side of the engine to get more air in.  Here is a list:Turbocharger upgrade K03 Super 42Hi-flow Turbo Outlet PipeHi-flow Charge PipeCold Air Intake (high flow induction)And then a new set of pure white headlights.After that, an exhaust and an ECU.  And then finally some new 17" wheels and tires.Wish me luck!
