I once had Maya Angelou explained to me as someone who just glows with quiet compassion. &nbsp;I wish I'd known her better. &nbsp;A quote that I have followed mentally for years, that I had no idea was attributed to her is "People will forget what you said, they will forget what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel." &nbsp;I strive everyday to make sure that every emotion I elicit in a conscious one.

<a name="more"></a>But I think that it is this quote from here that I will remember:
> We write for the same reason that we walk, talk, climb mountains or swim the oceans — because we can. We have some impulse within us that makes us want to explain ourselves to other human beings. That’s why we paint, that’s why we dare to love someone- because we have the impulse to explain who we are. Not just how tall we are, or thin… but who we are internally… perhaps even spiritually. There’s something, which impels us to show our inner-souls. The more courageous we are, the more we succeed in explaining what we know. -- Maya AngelouTo some extent, that's what #2minuteessay is about. &nbsp;It is about being grateful. &nbsp;It is about listening to myself through my own words. &nbsp;It is about feeding the impulse to explain who I am and what I stand for. &nbsp;With luck I will get better at explaining what I know. 

Thank you Madame Angelou.
