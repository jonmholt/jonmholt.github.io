So, I'm a week before race day. &nbsp;I out doing one last short mini-tri to grease the wheels before we pack up and hit the road. &nbsp;And then this happens:

There are other ones, but they're a lot more awkward to get a picture of.  Normally when I ride, I'm in the moment.  I spend the ride thinking about the route, the power output, the weather, how I'm feeling and when to eat.  Today, I was thinking about Whistler, the race, travelling to the race.  What we're doing after the race.  Even, big questions like if I want to do that overseas work, now is the time in life to do it.  In short, I was thinking about anything but the moment.

Today I was almost hit by a car and right near the end of the short 1 hour ride, I reacted too slowly to a pothole as I rounded another car.  The result is a bruised ego, what is likely to turn into a rather impressive bruise and some scrapes to the QuintanaRoo.  I don't blame anyone else but myself, even the driver who didn't see me.  Why? Because I should have been more focused on what I was doing and the world chose to teach me a hard lesson. But it is a lesson that I needed.  If you don't focus on what you're doing, it isn't going to turn out well.  Thankfully some scrapes are all that happened.

I now have my flat tires and my crash out of the way, so I'm confident going into race day.  All that's left is a really great experience in an amazing location...and I can't wait.  For those that have supported me throughout, thanks so much, it means the world.  For those that are going be there, I'll apologize in advance for the lack of attention you'll likely get from me until the race is done, but thank you too for taking the time out of your lives.  For those that will watch from afar, thank you too.  It is fun to know that there are people checking in all day long on my progress.
