Recently, I've spent a great deal of time thinking about the future and  the present, about success and abundance, about work and play, about purpose and happiness. I've leaned on some great minds like Tony Robbins, Michael Hyatt, Peter Diamandis and Russ Ruffino.  If I've learned anything, I've learned that in order to be successful in anything you do, you need to understand at your core the reasons for what you do.  You need to understand the why, and from that will come an ability to focus and an ability to succeed.

Success in anything requires guts and tenacity. Guts because great things never come from comfort zones. It takes guts to push through your own limits and to discover what's possible.  You need tenacity because no journey is linear.  There are always detours, switch backs and outright failures along the way.  Tenacity, and yes faith in your goal, are what keep us going.  Tenacity is the ability to keep trying *different* things until you succeed.  To do that, you have to have a firm vision of where you want to be.  And that vision should transcend even your wildest dreams, because we are our own worst enemies.

As part of my journey to success, I've learned I need to shift some priorities.  Subconsicously, I have always measured success through the lens of "Significance".  You can never succeed in that journey, because there will always be someone better, richer, smarter, etc.  Only through a deep understanding of what really matters to you (and abandoning other peoples opinions) that you can move forward.  I also learned how important my partnership with Faye is.  How vital she is to both my everyday, and my future.  Together we sat down and figured out what a wildly successful future looks like, and now we meditate on that vision everyday.

If you've read anything here, odds are good you've noticed that writing is a bit of a "thinking in public" exercise for me.  Writing is meditative in nature anyway, but to think in the public eye focuses your thoughts like nothing else can.  So as I dig deeper into our five mantras, if you will, I felt I would share in the hopes of inspiring myself and others.  This will be a five part series with one post for each mantra:

>[Part 1 - Our Third Pillar](/our-third-pillar): meditations on success as a couple

>[Part 2 - A Real Feeling of Security](/security): meditations on success in 'retirement'

>[Part 3 - Family Harmony](/family-harmony): meditations on the personal/family balance

>[Part 4 - Stewards of the world](/stewards-of-the-world): meditations on exploration and raising children

>[Part 5 - Giving Back](/giving-back): meditations on how to make a real difference
    
I don't expect anyone to really understand these musings.  They are personal in both their scope and their meaning.  But if anything here sparks a thought in you, please reach out.  I love to discuss the future, and if any of this resonates, I'm sure the future will be better with you in it.
